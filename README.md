# Wanderlust 

Wanderlust is an android application that keeps track of your travels. The application has two primary functions: 

  * The user has an opportunity to list his or hers coming travels and
    the application will calculate how many days it is left to the travel date. 
    
  * The application can count the total amount of countries the user has visited.
  
## How the program is built
The application is fairly easy with a start page that lists all travels. The user has an opportunity to see one specific travel for getting information, updating or deleting the travel. He or she can also add a new travel or continue to the user profile. 
In the user profile the user can select countries via checkboxes to get a calculation of the total amount of countries where he or she has travelled. The user can also continue from here to change the user information, log out from the application or delete the account. 

## Requirements
All the user need to use the application is a smart phone. The user must also register an account to become an member and be able to use the application. The registration is done on the first activity (log in) of the application. 

Everything else is included in the application.
